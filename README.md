## Inspiration
We engineered a Slack-inspired, real-time chat application using React, Flask, and SQLite3, included user authentication, message threading, and live updates. We designed a responsive single-page application (SPA) with dynamic content loading, channel-based message organization, and a user-friendly interface for both desktop and mobile views. We implemented robust backend RESTful API with Flask, ensuring secure communication and data integrity with parameterized SQL queries, and managed stateful web interactions without page reloads.
